# Evidence Gathering Protocol

Phase 2 delegation template for evidence-gathering agents. Each agent searches databases and returns structured evidence for one topic cluster.

**Evidence Parameters:** The coordinator's delegation task includes an `evidence_parameters` block (defined in the orchestrator skill, Phase 1). Read it to determine:
- `min_papers_per_cluster` — minimum unique papers to return (default 70)
- `saturation_criterion` — optional stopping rule (e.g., "<2% new unique in last 100")
- `snowball_rounds` — how many citation-chasing rounds to run (default 0)
- `total_bibliography_target` — optional total across all clusters
- `bibliography_target_is_hard_floor` — bool (default `true`). When `true`, the Phase 2V validator returns `FAIL_REQUIRES_USER_SIGNOFF` if cross-cluster unique DOIs fall below `total_bibliography_target` even after saturation/snowball exit conditions fire. Set to `false` only when the scope explicitly intends saturation as the terminal exit and the target is informational. See `comprev-evidence-validator` §`BIBLIOGRAPHY_FLOOR_HARD`.

If `evidence_parameters` is absent from the delegation task, use defaults (70 papers, no saturation, no snowball).

**Information barrier:** This skill contains ONLY evidence-gathering instructions. You cannot see how sections are written (Phase 7), how they are critiqued (Phase 8), or how figures are audited (Phase 6). This is intentional.

## Phase 2: Evidence Gathering

**Agent:** LITREVIEW (parallel — one per topic cluster) 

**Database selection:** The specific literature databases depend on the review's domain. This skill references PubMed, Europe PMC, bioRxiv, and medRxiv as examples because its initial deployment was in biomedical sciences. For other domains, substitute the appropriate databases:
- **Biomedical / life sciences:** PubMed, Europe PMC, bioRxiv, medRxiv
- **Physics / astronomy:** NASA ADS, INSPIRE-HEP, arXiv
- **Computer science:** DBLP, Semantic Scholar, arXiv
- **Social sciences / economics:** SSRN, RePEc, EconLit
- **General / multidisciplinary:** OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar, CrossRef, Google Scholar

CrossRef is domain-neutral and should always be included for DOI resolution. The principles below (DOI verification, full-text retrieval, database-first metadata) apply regardless of which databases are used. Where the text says "PubMed or Europe PMC," read it as "the appropriate domain database."

Each agent searches databases and returns structured evidence. Delegation MUST request this output schema:

```json
{
  "findings": [{"claim": "", "claim_source_sentence": "verbatim sentence from abstract (if text_access=abstract_only) or paper body (if text_access=fulltext)", "evidence": "", "effect_size": "", "effect_size_source_sentence": "verbatim sentence containing the number, or null if qualitative only", "n": 0, "study_system": "what was studied: e.g. species, material, model organism, dataset, language, market — domain-dependent", "replication_status": "", "replication_evidence_dois": ["doi1", "doi2"], "doi": "", "text_access": "fulltext | abstract_only"}],

    }
  ]
}
```

**MANDATORY — Coordinator delegation discipline:**
The coordinator writes the Phase 2 delegation task descriptions. These contain topic descriptions and search guidance for each cluster. The following rules apply to the coordinator when writing these delegations:

- Describe TOPICS to search for, not specific "Author & Author Year" references. Write "search for papers on [topic X properties], [mechanism Y], and [pathway Z function]" — NOT "find Armstrong & Bhatt 2012, Varga et al 2010."
- If you want to suggest a landmark paper, describe it by its finding: "the landmark paper establishing [key finding X]" — not by author names recalled from memory.
- NEVER generate author names, co-author names, or years from LLM memory for inclusion in a delegation. These are the primary vector for Bhatt-type contamination, where the LLM substitutes a high-frequency author name for the correct but less-frequent co-author.
- The evidence agents have database access. Trust them to discover the actual papers. Your role is to define what topics to cover and what questions to answer, not to pre-populate the reference list.
- **No author names in output:** Do NOT include author names, cite_keys, or "Author Year" labels anywhere in your output. Use DOIs as the sole paper identifier. The coordinator will derive cite_keys mechanically from database metadata. This eliminates the possibility of author-name contamination. If you need to refer to a paper in your reasoning, use the DOI or a descriptive phrase ("the 2023 whole-brain atlas paper") — never "Bhatt et al." or any author name from memory.

**Citation discipline:**
- Every paper MUST have a DOI verified against a database (PubMed, Europe PMC, or CrossRef) — not recalled from LLM memory.
- Every finding entry must include the DOI. If a DOI cannot be found, flag with `DOI-NOT-FOUND` and include enough metadata (title, authors, journal, year) for later resolution.
- Do NOT fabricate bibliographic metadata. If uncertain about a detail, search for it rather than guessing.
- **Hard drop rule for failed searches:** If a database search for a paper returns zero results, the paper MUST be excluded from the evidence output. Do not fill in metadata from memory. Do not include a paper just because the coordinator's task description mentioned it. The coordinator's suggested topics are search guidance, not a source of truth — if a paper cannot be found in PubMed, Europe PMC, or CrossRef, it may not exist. Mark it in a `search_failures` list (paper description, search queries tried, zero-result confirmation) but do NOT include it in `findings` or assign it a DOI.
- **Schema-only requirement:** Findings must contain ONLY the schema fields: `claim`, `claim_source_sentence`, `effect_size`, `effect_size_source_sentence`, `n`, `study_system`, `replication_status`, `replication_evidence_dois`, `doi`, `text_access`, `evidence`. If a cluster returns findings with additional fields (`title`, `authors`, `journal`, `year`, `pmid`, `volume`, `pages`, `cite_key`), send back: "Remove non-schema fields. Each extra free-text field is a fabrication vector — measured 74% hallucination rate when agents add an authors field. Cite_keys are assigned mechanically by the coordinator, not by agents."
- **Full-text retrieval requirement:** Every paper must have `text_access` set to `fulltext` or `abstract_only`, reflecting a genuine retrieval attempt. **Always prefer `fulltext`** — attempt full-text retrieval for every paper before falling back to `abstract_only`. Papers for which neither full text nor abstract was retrieved MUST be excluded entirely (move to `search_failures`); they cannot enter `findings` with a placeholder.

**Full-Text Retrieval Protocol :**

Agents MUST attempt full-text retrieval for ALL papers — not just the "top 50." Follow the 5-tier API protocol defined in `comprev-reviewer-agent` (PMC OA → publisher API → Europe PMC → bioRxiv/medRxiv/arXiv readers → `fetch_article_fulltext(doi)`). Publisher-API tiers have higher success rates for paywalled content; open-access tiers are the fallback.

The retrieval protocol (tier order, API tiers, size validation) is defined in the comprev-reviewer-agent skill.

**Size-based validation (MANDATORY after any retrieval):**
- Response > 15KB AND contains `<body>` tag → genuine fulltext → `text_access = "fulltext"`
- Response > 15KB but no `<body>` tag → inspect manually; may be metadata-heavy XML
- Response < 15KB → metadata-only or abstract-only → `text_access = "abstract_only"` regardless of HTTP status code
- PMC frequently returns HTTP 200 with a valid XML envelope containing only the abstract. The size check catches this (Failure Mode #23).

**Fulltext extraction rule (MANDATORY):**
When fulltext is genuinely retrieved (>15KB with `<body>` tag), the `claim_source_sentence` MUST come from the paper body — NOT from the abstract. Extract findings from the Results, Discussion, or other body sections. If you can only find a relevant sentence in the abstract, set `text_access = "abstract_only"` even if you have the fulltext available. The `text_access` field indicates where the SOURCE SENTENCE came from, not whether you had access to the paper.

This means:
- `text_access = "fulltext"` → source sentence is from the paper body, not findable in the abstract
- `text_access = "abstract_only"` → source sentence is from the abstract

The validator will check this: if `text_access = "fulltext"` but the source sentence IS found in the abstract, the finding fails validation. Extract deeper or label honestly.

**Coordinator full-text fallback tiers** apply to every paper. Agents call the 5-tier sequence directly using the MCP tools and `fetch_article_fulltext(doi)` as documented in `comprev-reviewer-agent`. Publisher-API keys (`ELSEVIER_API_KEY`, `SPRINGER_API_KEY`, `NCBI_API_KEY`) are read from the environment by `fetch_article_fulltext` automatically — agents do not pass them explicitly.
- **Text-only extraction requirement:** All `claim`, `effect_size`, and `figure_data.papers.value` fields must come from retrieved text. Every value must have a corresponding `_source_sentence`. Papers for which neither full text nor abstract was retrieved must be excluded from findings entirely and moved to `search_failures` — they cannot contribute claims, source sentences, or quantitative data, and have no valid `text_access` value (`metadata_only` is not allowed).
- **Figure data requirement:** Every `figure_data.papers.value` must have a non-null `value_source_sentence`. Papers without a traceable number are excluded from figure comparisons.
- **Replication evidence requirement:** `replication_status` = `independently_replicated` requires ≥2 DOIs from different labs in `replication_evidence_dois`. `contested` requires conflicting DOIs. Otherwise use `replication_unknown`.

**Coordinator enforcement obligation:** These are gates, not advisories. Send back non-compliant clusters via `send_message`.

**Source sentence self-validation (MANDATORY before final save):**

After extracting all findings and before saving the evidence JSON, run this validation on EVERY finding:

1. For each finding, retrieve the paper's abstract from Europe PMC using the DOI:
   ```
   https://www.ebi.ac.uk/europepmc/webservices/rest/search?query=DOI:{doi}&format=json&resultType=core
   ```
2. Check whether `claim_source_sentence` is a verbatim substring of the retrieved abstract text. Use the FULL sentence for matching — not the first 30-50 characters.
3. For findings with `text_access = "fulltext"`, the source sentence may come from the paper body rather than the abstract. These pass validation IF the fulltext was genuinely retrieved (>15KB with `<body>` tag).
4. For ANY finding where the source sentence is NOT found in the abstract AND no genuine fulltext was retrieved: **re-extract the finding from the actual abstract text.** Read the abstract, find the most relevant sentence, and copy it verbatim.
5. Report validation results in the structured output:
   - `total_checked`: number of findings validated
   - `source_in_abstract`: exact substring match in abstract
   - `source_in_fulltext`: source from fulltext body (fulltext verified >15KB)
   - `source_not_found`: not found in any retrieved text (these are protocol violations)
   - `re_extracted`: findings that were re-extracted after failing validation

**What counts as a violation:**
- Paper title used as `claim_source_sentence` (titles are not findings)
- Paraphrased sentence that doesn't appear verbatim in the abstract
- Source sentence manufactured from memory without retrieval
- `text_access = "fulltext"` when no >15KB document was retrieved for this DOI

**Anti-gaming rule:** The validation must use the FULL `claim_source_sentence` as the search string, not a truncated prefix. Matching on the first 30-50 characters is insufficient — it passes paraphrases that diverge after the opening words. Use `source_sentence in abstract_text` (full string containment), not `source_sentence[:50] in abstract_text`.

The validator skill defines the binary gate. See `comprev-evidence-validator.md` for the authoritative criteria. Aim for full compliance; do not optimise to the floor.

## Snowball Protocol

When `evidence_parameters.snowball_rounds` ≥ 1 (passed in the delegation task), execute citation chasing AFTER the initial keyword search pass:

**Per round:**
1. **Rank** the current result set by citation count (OpenAlex `cited_by_count`).
2. **Select** the top 50 most-cited papers (or all papers if fewer than 50).
3. **Backward snowball:** For each selected paper, retrieve its reference list via OpenAlex (`referenced_works`). Add any DOI not already in the result set.
4. **Forward snowball:** For each selected paper, retrieve its cited-by list via OpenAlex (`cited_by` endpoint, paginated). Add any DOI not already in the result set.
5. **Screen** newly added DOIs by title/abstract against the cluster's inclusion criteria. Remove irrelevant additions.
6. **Log** the round: `{"round": N, "seed_papers": 50, "backward_added": X, "forward_added": Y, "after_screen": Z, "cumulative_unique": W}`.

Repeat for `snowball_rounds` iterations. Each round uses the expanded set (including previous round's additions) as the seed, so citation chains propagate.

**Important:** Snowball rounds will surface papers that don't contain the original search keywords but are cited by / cite papers that do. This is the primary mechanism for escaping keyword-search blind spots. Do NOT filter snowball additions by keyword match — screen them by topical relevance to the cluster.


## Saturation Protocol

When `evidence_parameters.saturation_criterion` is set (e.g., `"<2% new unique in last 100"`), the agent must track per-pass yield and stop only when the criterion fires:

**Tracking:**
After each search pass (initial keyword search, each snowball round, each query expansion), record:
```json
{
  "pass_type": "keyword | snowball_round_N | expansion_N",
  "query_or_method": "the search string or 'forward snowball on top-50'",
  "records_examined": 100,
  "new_unique_relevant": 3,
  "new_unique_rate": 0.03,
  "cumulative_unique": 287,
  "cumulative_screened_in": 245
}
```

**Stopping rule:**
- Parse the criterion string. Example: `"<2% new unique in last 100"` means: in the most recent pass of 100 records, fewer than 2% were new unique relevant papers not already in the result set.
- The criterion must fire in **two consecutive passes** to trigger a stop. A single low-yield pass could be a database-specific gap, not true saturation.
- `min_papers_per_cluster` (if set) acts as a hard floor: even if the saturation criterion fires early, do not stop until the floor is met.

**Output:**
Save `saturation_log.json` as an artifact alongside the evidence package. This log is consumed at Phase 2V by `comprev-evidence-validator`'s `SATURATION_LOGGED` check, at Phase 14V/20V by `comprev-myst-validator`'s `EVIDENCE_PARAMETERS_HONORED` check, and by the Methods section (Phase 13) to document the search strategy.



## Per-Frame Findings Budget (Compaction Mitigation)

Phase 2 evidence gathering is the only phase in the pipeline that empirically produces **multi-compaction chains** within a single sub-agent — a 52% per-frame compaction rate, with ~20% of Phase 2 children showing signals of more than one rollover. To eliminate this risk, every Phase 2 child runs under a hard findings-count budget and exits cleanly when the budget is hit. The coordinator forks a fresh continuation child if more searching is needed.

**The budget rule:**
- **Maximum findings per child frame: 40** (one HARDENED checkpoint cycle plus a small buffer).
- The agent MUST check `len(set(f["doi"] for f in findings))` after every save and every snowball round.
- When the count reaches **40 unique findings**, the agent must stop searching, save final state, and exit — even if `min_papers_per_cluster` has not been met. The coordinator will fork a continuation.
- This budget is **independent of saturation**. Saturation can fire earlier and stops the *entire cluster*; the per-frame budget can fire repeatedly and only stops the *current child*.

**On budget exit, the agent MUST:**

1. Save the evidence JSON one last time as `cluster_NN_evidence.json` (versioned via `version_of` if a prior version exists).
2. Save `cluster_NN_search_state.json` with the search-state fields needed for resumption:
   ```json
   {
     "cluster_id": "cluster_06",
     "section_id": "section_07",
     "passes_completed": ["epmc:disinhibit*", "epmc:VIP+SST", "openalex:disinhibition", "snowball_round_1"],
     "passes_remaining": ["epmc:gain_modulation", "openalex:L1_disinhibitory", "snowball_round_2"],
     "snowball_seeds_used": ["10.1038/nature12676", "10.1038/nn.3446", "..."],
     "seen_dois_artifact_id": "<artifact id of seen-DOI list, written as one DOI per line>",
     "saturation_log_artifact_id": "<artifact id>",
     "papers_so_far": 38,
     "evidence_artifact_id": "<latest cluster_NN_evidence.json version id>",
     "exit_reason": "frame_budget_reached | saturation | papers_target_met"
   }
   ```
3. Return a **structured output** with:
   ```json
   {
     "continuation_required": true,
     "search_state_artifact_id": "<id of cluster_NN_search_state.json>",
     "evidence_artifact_id": "<id of cluster_NN_evidence.json>",
     "papers_so_far": 38,
     "exit_reason": "frame_budget_reached"
   }
   ```
   Set `continuation_required: false` only when `exit_reason` is `saturation` or `papers_target_met`.
4. Do NOT attempt one more search pass "to round up." Exit immediately.

**On continuation entry, the agent receives:**
- A standard Phase 2 delegation task with one extra block: `continuation_state` containing the previous search-state and evidence-artifact IDs.
- The agent MUST: load the previous evidence JSON, load the seen-DOI list, skip every pass already in `passes_completed`, and deduplicate every new hit against the seen-DOI list before adding it.

**Append-only preservation (HARD RULE).** A continuation child MUST treat existing `findings`, `conflicts`, and `figure_data` arrays as append-only. On startup, snapshot the prior counts; before `submit_output`, assert:

```python
import json
prior = json.loads(prior_evidence_blob)
prior_conflicts_n   = len(prior.get("conflicts", []))
prior_figure_data_n = len(prior.get("figure_data", []))
prior_findings_n    = len(prior.get("findings", []))

# … child does its work, building `final` …

assert len(final["findings"])    >= prior_findings_n,    "findings array shrank"
assert len(final["conflicts"])   >= prior_conflicts_n,   "conflicts array shrank"
assert len(final["figure_data"]) >= prior_figure_data_n, "figure_data array shrank"
```

These three assertions are gate checks, not documented exits — a child that fails them MUST be re-forked. The 40-findings budget is measured against *findings added in this child*, not the cumulative count. If the cluster still hasn't saturated after this child's 40 are added, the agent emits another `continuation_required: true` and the coordinator forks again.

**Why 40.** 30 is the existing checkpoint cadence — a child must be able to hit 30 and still have headroom to finalize the schema (homogeneity_check, figure_data, conflicts). 50 puts the heaviest children too close to the compaction threshold. 40 leaves a safe buffer.

## Evidence Schema

Every evidence-gathering agent returns a JSON matching this schema. The coordinator validates compliance on return.

```json
{
  "findings": [{"claim": "", "claim_source_sentence": "verbatim sentence from abstract (if text_access=abstract_only) or paper body (if text_access=fulltext)", "evidence": "", "effect_size": "", "effect_size_source_sentence": "verbatim sentence containing the number, or null if qualitative only", "n": 0, "study_system": "what was studied: e.g. species, material, model organism, dataset, language, market — domain-dependent", "replication_status": "", "replication_evidence_dois": ["doi1", "doi2"], "doi": "", "text_access": "fulltext | abstract_only"}],
  "conflicts": [{"paper_a_doi": "", "paper_b_doi": "", "paper_a_claim": "verbatim sentence from paper A", "paper_b_claim": "verbatim sentence from paper B", "nature_of_conflict": "what disagrees and on what dimension", "resolution_status": "open | resolved-by-replication | resolved-by-method"}],

      ],
      "comparison_type": "cross-study conflict | convergent evidence | dose-response | timeline",
      "what_it_reveals": "Why this comparison matters",
      "suggested_plot_type": "forest plot | grouped bar | heatmap | timeline | scatter",
      "homogeneity_check": {
        "scope_region_uniform": "true | false",
        "scope_population_uniform": "true | false",
        "taxonomic_level_uniform": "true | false",
        "n_definition_uniform": "true | false",
        "caveats": ["list any comparability issues across entries, e.g. 'Paper X is whole-brain while others are cortex-only'"]
      }
    }
  ],
  "search_failures": [
    {
      "suggested_reference": "description from coordinator task",
      "searches_tried": ["query1", "query2"],
      "result": "zero results in PubMed and Europe PMC",
      "action": "excluded from evidence"
    }
```


**MANDATORY — Evidence JSON compliance:**
- Conflicts MUST use exactly these fields: `paper_a_doi`, `paper_b_doi`, `paper_a_claim`, `paper_b_claim`, `nature_of_conflict`, `resolution_status`. No other field names. No nested objects for sides. No `papers[]` arrays. No custom field names per conflict type. Every conflict MUST have both DOIs.
- JSON values: use `null` for missing values, NEVER the Python string `"None"`. Agents must ensure None→null conversion during JSON serialization.
- `figure_data` papers arrays MUST have unique DOIs. Deduplicate before saving. If the same paper appears multiple times in a comparison, keep only the first entry.
- Every finding MUST carry a non-empty `replication_status` (`replicated` | `unreplicated` | `disputed` | `single-study`). When `replication_status = replicated`, `replication_evidence_dois` MUST list ≥1 DOI. The Methods section (M.4) and the validator both summarise this distribution.

# Working Procedures (from comprev-reviewer-agent)

## Part III: How to Work

### Coverage and Search
- ≥ `min_papers_per_cluster` papers per major topic (from `evidence_parameters`). If `total_bibliography_target` is set, redistribute effort across clusters to meet it. If `saturation_criterion` is set, continue searching until the criterion fires (see Saturation Protocol below)
- Seed papers → citation chains (3 iterations) → systematic database search
- ≥6 distinct targeted queries per topic across domain-appropriate databases (e.g., PubMed, bioRxiv, Europe PMC, OpenAlex for biomedical; ADS, arXiv for physics; DBLP, Semantic Scholar for CS)
- Search must extend beyond landmark papers to include: replication studies, negative results, methodological variants, cross-domain extensions, and cross-system comparison studies
- For each topic, after initial search, identify which subtopics have <10 papers and run dedicated follow-up queries for those gaps

### DOI Provenance: Search-First, Never Memory-First

DOIs are opaque identifiers. LLMs do not reliably know the mapping
between paper titles and DOI strings. A DOI that looks correct (right
journal prefix, plausible format) frequently points to a different paper.

**The ONLY permitted workflow for adding a paper to findings:**
1. Run a database search query (using domain-appropriate databases — e.g., Europe PMC, PubMed, OpenAlex, bioRxiv for biomedical)
2. Parse the results returned by the API
3. Extract the DOI from the result object: `doi = result.get("doi")`
4. Use this DOI for all subsequent steps (article_getter, fulltext retrieval)

**PROHIBITED patterns:**
```python
# ❌ NEVER pre-populate paper lists from memory
key_papers_to_verify = [
    {"doi": "10.1038/s41586-019-1506-7", "title": "..."},
]

# ❌ NEVER create landmark/seed paper dicts with hardcoded DOIs
landmark_verified = {
    "10.xxxx/some-recalled-doi": {"title": "..."},
}

# ❌ NEVER type a DOI as a string literal in add_finding()
add_finding("10.1038/nn.1199", title="...", ...)

# ❌ NEVER create master_papers / core_papers / seed_papers dicts
landmark_dois = {"10.xxxx/some-recalled-doi": "Author et al 20XX - Famous Result"}
```

**REQUIRED pattern:**
```python
# ✅ ALWAYS extract DOIs by iterating over search results
for r in data.get('resultList', {}).get('result', []):
    doi = r.get('doi')  # DOI comes FROM the API
    if doi:
        title = r.get('title', '')
        papers.append({'doi': doi, 'title': title, ...})
```

If you know a paper should be included but it didn't appear in search results: Do NOT hardcode its DOI. Instead:
- Run a NEW search query using the paper's title as the search string
- Use the DOI returned by that title search
- If the title search returns zero results, put it in `search_failures`

LLMs recall paper titles accurately but DOI strings inaccurately. The title is usually right; the DOI is often wrong. By searching for the title, you get the correct DOI from the database instead of fabricating one from memory.

### Paper Verification
- Every cited paper MUST have a verified DOI
- Search databases to confirm: title, authors, journal, year, DOI
- When using PubMed: use esummary (JSON), not efetch (XML) — JSON parses reliably; XML silently drops fields
- Never cite from LLM memory alone — always verify against a database
- If a paper cannot be found in any database, flag it explicitly
- Citation keys MUST be ASCII-only. Replace accented characters with their ASCII equivalents (ø→o, ö→o, ü→u, é→e, ñ→n, ç→c, å→a, etc.). Example: Lensjø2017 → Lensjo2017. Non-ASCII keys cause LaTeX compilation failures.


### Consensus Challenge Search (Mandatory)

For every major consensus claim you encounter during evidence gathering, ask:
**"Which paper first demonstrated this experimentally?"**

- If you find the primary experimental source → include it in findings with a note
- If you CANNOT find the primary source (only reviews repeating the claim) → log it as an
  `evidence_gap` with type: `false_consensus_risk`:
  ```json
  {
    "topic": "the specific mechanistic claim",
    "what_is_missing": "Primary experimental demonstration — claim is repeated across reviews but original data source not identified",
    "why_it_matters": "Risk of false consensus: widely stated claim without traceable experimental evidence"
  }
  ```

Additionally, for each major topic, run at least one **contradiction search**:
- "[established mechanism] challenged OR revised OR reconsidered"
- "[textbook claim] incorrect OR alternative OR reinterpreted"
- "[mechanism] new evidence against OR contradicts"

Recent papers (last 2-3 years) that revise long-standing claims are among the most
valuable findings for a critical review. Prioritize them.

### Evidence Gathering Output
When gathering evidence (Phase 2 of orchestrator), produce STRUCTURED output — not prose. Return findings, conflicts, unreplicated claims, evidence gaps, strongest/weakest evidence, and figure_data as specified by the orchestrator's schema.

**For every paper you include, follow this procedure:**

1. **Retrieve metadata and text.** Call `article_getter` with the DOI. Do not store title, authors, journal, volume, or pages — those fields do not exist in your output schema. Do NOT generate cite_keys — the coordinator assigns them mechanically from database metadata after evidence gathering. If `article_getter` returns abstract but no full text, try these additional sources before giving up:
   - If the paper has a PMCID: call `bc_get_europepmc_fulltext` for full-text XML.
   - Search domain-appropriate full-text sources by DOI (e.g., `bc_get_europepmc_articles` for biomedical — check for `fullTextUrlList` for open-access URLs). If a URL is returned, fetch it.
   - For preprints: use the appropriate reader — `read_biorxiv_paper`, `read_medrxiv_paper`, or `read_arxiv_paper` as applicable to the domain.

   Set `text_access` to `fulltext` (paper body retrieved) or `abstract_only` (only abstract retrieved). If neither was retrieved, do NOT include the paper — move it to `search_failures` instead.

   After retrieving metadata, COMPARE the returned title against the title from the search result that provided this DOI:
   ```python
   search_title_words = set(search_result_title.lower().split()[:10])
   retrieved_title_words = set(retrieved_title.lower().split()[:10])
   overlap = len(search_title_words & retrieved_title_words) / max(len(search_title_words), len(retrieved_title_words))

   if overlap < 0.3:
       # DOI POINTS TO WRONG PAPER — do not use this DOI
       # Search by title instead to find the correct DOI
   ```
   This catches DOIs that resolve but point to a different paper.

   **After retrieval, call `add_finding()` using ONLY these fields:**
   ```python
   add_finding(
       doi=doi,                          # from search result
       claim=claim,                      # paraphrased from retrieved text
       claim_source_sentence=verbatim,   # copied from retrieved text
       effect_size=effect_size,           # from retrieved text, or null
       effect_size_source_sentence=src,   # verbatim sentence, or null
       n=n,                              # from retrieved text, or null
       study_system=study_system,        # from retrieved text
       text_access=text_access,          # fulltext | abstract_only
       replication_status="replication_unknown",
       # ↑ Default — but do NOT accept blindly. Before finalizing each finding:
       #   • Search for the same result from a different lab → "independently_replicated" (list DOIs)
       #   • Search for contradicting results → "contested" (list DOIs)
       #   • Only keep "replication_unknown" after active search found nothing
       replication_evidence_dois=[],
   )
   ```
   There is no `title` parameter. There is no `authors` parameter. There is no `cite_key` parameter (the coordinator assigns cite_keys mechanically from database metadata). There is no `journal`, `volume`, or `pages` parameter. If you find yourself typing any of those field names, you are inventing schema fields that do not exist — stop.

**Fulltext sourcing requirement:** If `text_access` is `fulltext`, the `claim_source_sentence` MUST come from the BODY of the paper (results, methods, or discussion section) — NOT the abstract. Abstract-sourced sentences for fulltext papers are a compliance failure. Include the paper section identifier (e.g., "Results, paragraph 3" or "Discussion") as a prefix to the source sentence.


2. **Extract findings from the retrieved text.** Read what you retrieved. Identify sentences describing the paper's main results. Paraphrase them as the `claim`. Copy the verbatim sentence(s) into `claim_source_sentence`. Do not describe findings from LLM memory — describe what the text says.

"When text_access is fulltext, extract claims from the Results and Methods sections — not just the abstract. Full text contains effect sizes with confidence intervals, exact sample sizes per condition, control comparisons, and methodological caveats that abstracts omit. These are the measurements that distinguish a landmark finding entry from a confirmatory one. When text_access is abstract_only, extract what the abstract provides but note the lower resolution."

3. **Extract numbers from the retrieved text.** Numbers are
   measurements. They come from your instrument (the text), not memory.

   a. Search for sentences containing digits, percentages,
      fold-changes, or units.
   b. When you find a number: copy the ENTIRE sentence into
      `value_source_sentence`. This is your raw data.
   c. When the text describes a result without a number:
      set `effect_size` to the qualitative description. This is a
      valid observation at lower resolution.
   d. When you cannot find the result: set `effect_size` to null.
      This is a null measurement — record it, do not fill it.
   e. For `figure_data`: ONLY include papers where you found the
      number in the text with a source sentence.

4. **Papers without text access.** Papers for which neither full text nor abstract was retrieved MUST be excluded from findings entirely. Move them to `search_failures` with `action` = "no text available for evidence extraction (neither full text nor abstract retrieved)." Such papers cannot contribute claims, source sentences, or quantitative data, and have no valid `text_access` value — `metadata_only` is NOT an allowed value.

5. **Replication status.** To mark a finding as `independently_replicated`, you must have found ≥2 papers from different labs (different last authors) reporting the same result. List their DOIs in `replication_evidence_dois`. For `contested`, list the conflicting DOIs. If you cannot identify specific replicating or conflicting papers from your searches, use `replication_unknown`.

6. **Before saving, verify your count.** `len(set(f['doi'] for f in findings))` must be ≥ `min_papers_per_cluster` per section covered (read this value from the `evidence_parameters` in your delegation task; default 70). If below target, you are over-filtering — go back and include replication studies, negative results, and cross-area extensions.

7. **Before saving, verify extraction rates.** The orchestrator will reject clusters that fall below these thresholds:
   - **Effect size rate:** ≥30% of findings must have a non-empty, non-null `effect_size` (excluding "not reported", "N/A", "qualitative"). If below 30%, return to abstracts/full text for your most-cited papers (prioritize the top ~50 by citation count) and extract any reported numbers.
   - **Sample size rate:** ≥20% of findings must have `n` as an integer > 0. Check abstracts for cell counts, animal counts, recording counts.
   - **Replication status rate:** ≤70% of findings may have `replication_status` = `replication_unknown`. Prioritize your most-cited claims (the top ~50 by citation count) and actively search for replication or contradiction evidence before accepting "unknown."

**figure_data is mandatory:** For each major conflict or convergence, extract quantitative values from each paper's text. Every `figure_data.papers.value` must have a `value_source_sentence`. If the number isn't in the text, exclude that paper from the comparison.

**Comparability fields:** For each figure_data comparison, also record:
- `scope_region`: the anatomical/geographic scope of the measurement
- `scope_population`: what entity population was measured
- `taxonomic_level`: the classification granularity of any count
- `n_definition`: what n counts (e.g., samples collected vs samples post-QC)
- `n_analyzed`: the post-QC or actually-analyzed count, if different from n

**MANDATORY — Homogeneity record (`homogeneity_check`):**
After assembling all entries in a comparison, record a `homogeneity_check` block. Every entry in `figure_data[i].papers[]` MUST carry the seven scope fields: `scope_region`, `scope_population`, `taxonomic_level`, `experimental_conditions`, `method`, `n_definition`, and `value_source_sentence`. The `homogeneity_check` then summarises whether each is uniform across the comparison (`scope_region_uniform`, `scope_population_uniform`, `taxonomic_level_uniform`, `n_definition_uniform`) and lists `caveats[]` for any non-uniform field. The comparability audit (Phase 6) reads these to catch misleading cross-study figures; missing scope fields hard-fail there.

### Citation Density
Before saving any .tex file, count your `\citep{}`/`\citet{}` commands and divide by the number of substantial paragraphs (exclude figure environments, single-sentence transitions, and subsection-opening topic sentences followed by elaboration). Report this as `citations_per_paragraph` in your structured output. If below 4.0, restructure: merge consecutive single-paper paragraphs into synthesis paragraphs that cite 5–8 papers in dialogue before each paragraph's concluding synthesis sentence.

### Synthesis Structure
Organize by **debates and open questions**, not just topics. Each section: historical context, strongest evidence, contradictions, limitations, critical assessment.

**Integration density targets:**
- Each synthesis paragraph should cite 5–8 papers in dialogue, not cover them sequentially.
- Structure: "Claim sentence citing \citep{A, B}. \citet{A} established X under condition C1. \citet{B} extended this to C2 but found a discrepancy in Z. \citet{C} and \citet{D} resolved this by showing condition-dependence \citep{C, D}. Confirmatory evidence spans three additional preparations \citep{E, F, G}. Together, these studies establish [synthesis], though [remaining gap]."
- Reserve sequential paper-by-paper exposition for historical narratives where chronology IS the argument.
