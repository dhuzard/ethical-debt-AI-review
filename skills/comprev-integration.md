# Integration and Bookend Protocol

Phase 10 (six-pass integration across all sections) and Phase 11 (Introduction, Conclusion, and Abstract). The integration role sees the full document structure — this is intentional, as integration requires cross-section awareness.

**Information barrier:** No information barrier. The integrator needs full document visibility to ensure consistency, transitions, and cross-references.

---

## Phase 10: Integration

**Agent:** LITREVIEW

**PREREQUISITE:**
```python
require_phase('5_bibliography')
check_gate('gate_bibliography.json')
```

Single agent reads all sections, performs:

**Citation discipline for ALL integration passes:** Do NOT introduce new citations. Only rearrange, rephrase, or strengthen references to papers already cited in the sections.

#### 6a. Transition Pass
Rewrite boundary paragraphs between consecutive sections for natural flow. Ending of Section N should create expectation that Section N+1 answers.

#### 6b. Cross-Reference Resolution
Verify every scaffold cross-reference exists in text. Add missing ones. **Flag and convert any hardcoded §N.M or "Section N.M" references** — these must become `{ref}` cross-references with labels. Add `(label)=` anchors to target subsection headings as needed. Ensure references are specific ("As discussed in Section 3, the laminar distribution...") not vague ("As mentioned earlier...").

#### 6c. Terminology and Voice
Consistent terminology throughout. Fix terms used differently across sections. Abbreviations defined on first use. Smooth voice inconsistencies.

#### 6d. Argument Continuity Audit
Does the argument build as scaffold intended? Where does the logical chain break? Does conclusion follow from what sections actually contain?

#### 6e. Figure Consistency
Consistent color palette, fonts, line weights across all figures. No duplicate labels. All {numref} and {ref} resolve. Caption depth consistent.

**CRITICAL — Duplicate :name: prevention:** Before adding a `:name:` directive to any figure block, CHECK if one already exists. If the figure already contains a `:name:` line, do NOT add another. Duplicate `:name:` directives cause MyST to silently fail rendering the entire figure — no error, no warning, just a missing image. When standardising figure labels, REPLACE existing `:name:` values if needed, never append a second one.
- **File existence audit:** Verify every `\includegraphics{}` path corresponds to an actual figure file produced during Phase 7. Report any mismatches as a `filename_mismatches` list in the integration log.

#### 6f. Structural Hygiene
```
□ Zero \begin{thebibliography} blocks
□ Zero \documentclass in section files  
□ Zero \bibitem entries in section files
□ All \citep{}/\citet{} keys collected into master list
□ Consistent \citep{AuthorYear}/\citet{AuthorYear} format
□ No duplicate \label{} definitions
□ All \ref{} resolve to existing \label{}
```


**Output requirement:** The integration agent MUST save UPDATED versions of each section .md 
and .tex file. The coordinator verifies: diff between pre- and post-integration files must show 
changes in at least the transition paragraphs (first/last paragraphs of each section).
If the agent reports "6 passes completed" but the files are unchanged → send back.

**GATE ARTIFACT:** After all 6 passes complete, save `gate_integration.json`:

```python
gate_data = {
    'passes_completed': ['6a_transition', '6b_crossref', '6c_terminology',
                         '6d_continuity', '6e_figures', '6f_hygiene'],
    'filename_mismatches': [...],  # from 6e
    'structural_issues': [...],    # from 6f
}
json.dump(gate_data, open('gate_integration.json', 'w'), indent=2)
advance_phase('6_integration', '<saved_version_id>')
```


## Phase 11: Introduction and Conclusion

**Agent:** LITREVIEW

**MANDATORY:** Written AFTER all body sections are complete and integrated. Writing them first commits to conclusions before evidence is reviewed.

**PREREQUISITE:**
```python
require_phase('6_integration')
check_gate('gate_integration.json')
```

**Citation discipline:** Introduction and conclusion may ONLY cite papers already cited in the body sections.

**Master citation list (HARD RULE).** Before drafting, compute the body-only master citation set:

```python
import re
from pathlib import Path

master = set()
for md in sorted(Path("content").glob("[0-9][0-9]_*.md")):
    # body sections only — skip 00_frontmatter; the integrator decides which file
    # numbers count as bodies, but conventionally 01..(n_sections-0) are bodies.
    text = md.read_text()
    for m in re.finditer(r"\{cite:[pt]\}`([^`]+)`", text):
        for k in m.group(1).split(","):
            master.add(k.strip())
```

The Introduction and Conclusion may cite ONLY from `master`. Before `submit_output`, assert:

```python
intro_keys = {k.strip() for m in re.finditer(r"\{cite:[pt]\}`([^`]+)`", intro_text) for k in m.group(1).split(",")}
concl_keys = {k.strip() for m in re.finditer(r"\{cite:[pt]\}`([^`]+)`", concl_text) for k in m.group(1).split(",")}
novel = (intro_keys | concl_keys) - master
assert not novel, f"Bookend introduces {len(novel)} novel keys: {sorted(novel)[:10]}"
```

Each cite-key block is decomposed on `,` so multi-key directives like `` {cite:p}`Key1, Key2` `` are counted correctly.

**Post-writing critic (Phase 12):** After Phase 11 completes, the coordinator launches a blinded bookend critic (Phase 12, specified in `comprev-critic.md`). The critic is a different child frame from the Phase 11 writer. It re-runs the master-citation check above as a safety net, and inspects every claim against paper abstracts. MUST_FIX findings are sent back to the Phase 11 writer for revision before the pipeline advances to Phase 13 (Methods).

- **Introduction:** Receives 1-paragraph summaries of all sections + central argument + master citation list. Frames problem, explains why review is needed, previews argument arc naturally.
- **Conclusion:** Receives section summaries + key findings including conflicts and gaps + master citation list. Synthesizes (not summarizes), acknowledges limitations, identifies open questions.


**MANDATORY — Abstract and Frontmatter Assembly:**

Phase 11 writes a 250–400 word Abstract AND composes the final
`content/00_frontmatter.md` from the template scaffold. The Abstract body must:

- Cite the UNIQUE paper count from `citation_key_map` (not the pre-dedup count
  from evidence compliance).
- Summarize the central thesis, key findings, and methodology.
- Avoid inline citations (abstract is self-contained prose).
- Be one paragraph, or at most four short paragraphs.

The final frontmatter file MUST follow this fixed layout (the template ships a
scaffold with placeholders — fill them, do not reorder):

```
---
title: "<REVIEW TITLE>"
subtitle: A Reproducible Computational Review
---

# <REVIEW TITLE>

```{authorship-explorer}
:authors: ./authors.yml
:height: 600px
```

:::{admonition} AI-Generated Content Disclosure
:class: danger

**This review was generated with substantial AI assistance.** ...

**What the AI did:** <one paragraph, pipeline-filled>
**What the human did:** <one paragraph, pipeline-filled>
**All evidence is traceable:** ... links to Methods and Evidence Database ...
:::

## Abstract

<250–400 word abstract body>

**Keywords:** keyword1, keyword2, keyword3, ...
```

**Layout rules (enforced at gate):**
1. `subtitle` in frontmatter is required — the site header composes `title: subtitle`.
2. `{authorship-explorer}` widget MUST come immediately after the H1, before any
   other content. The widget binds to DOM anchors that MyST only emits when it
   follows the H1 in source order; placing it at the bottom of the file silently
   breaks rendering.
3. AI-Disclosure admonition is mandatory on every computational review produced
   by this pipeline. Fill in both "What the AI did" and "What the human did"
   paragraphs — do not delete the admonition block.
4. `## Abstract` heading must be present (some templates styled abstract as
   un-headed — don't; the reader and search index need the anchor).
5. Keywords line at bottom, bold label, comma-separated, 4–8 terms.

Save the assembled file directly to `content/00_frontmatter.md`. Phase 14
(assembly) verifies the five layout rules above and fails the gate if any are
violated.

**GATE ARTIFACT:** After Phase 11 writes Introduction, Conclusion, Abstract, and
frontmatter, save `gate_intro_conclusion.json`:

```python
gate_data = {
    'introduction_artifact_id': '<saved_version_id>',
    'conclusion_artifact_id':   '<saved_version_id>',
    'abstract_artifact_id':     '<saved_version_id>',
    'frontmatter_artifact_id':  '<saved_version_id>',
    'novel_citations': [],   # MUST be empty — no new citations beyond body sections
    'master_citation_count': N,
}
json.dump(gate_data, open('gate_intro_conclusion.json', 'w'), indent=2)
advance_phase('11_intro_conclusion', '<saved_version_id>')
```

## Output Hygiene

FORBIDDEN in review text: Operon, scaffold, evidence package, framework failure, adversarial search, verdict, orchestrator, batch, sub-agent, revision manifest, prediction error, replication scorecard (as section title), paper weight, epistemic checkpoint.

Allowed scientific uses: "phase" (oscillation), "convergence" (convergent evidence), "scaffold" (developmental scaffolding), "recursive" (recursive processing).

**Scope.** The check applies to every text artifact Phase 10/11 emits: body sections, `00_frontmatter.md` (including the AI-Disclosure admonition), and the abstract. The AI-Disclosure block describes the pipeline using neutral terms — "directed specialist tools", "data-curation and literature-review components", "Phase 8 assessments" — not internal vocabulary. The frontmatter is held to the same `FORBIDDEN_LEXICON` standard as the bodies; the validator at Phase 14V scans frontmatter, Methods, authors.yml, and the LaTeX manuscript on the same pass.

**Test:** Could a reader tell this was produced by an automated system? If yes → fail.
