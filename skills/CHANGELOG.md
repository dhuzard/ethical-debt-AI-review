# Skill catalogue v28 → v29

## File changes

- `comprev-orchestrator-v28.md` → **`comprev-orchestrator-v29.md`** (rename)
- All other skill filenames unchanged
- Cross-references updated from `comprev-orchestrator-v28` to `comprev-orchestrator-v29` in:
  - `comprev-dataml-phases.md`
  - `comprev-deploy-polish.md`
  - `comprev-myst-validator.md`
  - `comprev-reviewer-agent.md`

## Filename conventions (Phase 5 + 14 outputs)

- Per-section evidence package: was `section_NN_evidence_package.json`, now `evidence_section_NN.json`
- Per-section scaffold extract: was `section_NN_scaffold_extract.json`, now `scaffold_section_NN.json`

The two filename stems are now distinct enough that VID-swap errors at delegation time are immediately visible.

## New validator checks (`comprev-myst-validator.md`)

| Check | Phases | What it asserts |
|---|---|---|
| `BIBLIOGRAPHY_PATH_MATCHES_MYSTYML` | 14V, 20V | Every path in `myst.yml` `project.bibliography` exists, ≥1 KB, ≥100 `@`-entries |
| `BIB_CITE_KEYS_RESOLVE` | 14V, 20V (fallback) | When `myst build` is deferred, every `{cite:[pt]}` and `\cite[pt]` key in `content/*.md` + `latex/manuscript.tex` resolves in the declared bibliography |
| `EVIDENCE_FINDINGS_ARE_OBJECTS` | 14V, 20V | `findings` arrays contain finding objects, not cite_key strings |
| `FIGURE_NOTEBOOK_SELF_CONTAINED` | 14V, 20V | Notebooks are runnable in a vanilla SciPy environment; only `shared_style` may be project-local, and every symbol it exports is actually defined |
| `NO_WRITER_SCRATCHPAD` | 7V, 14V, 19V, 20V | Body prose contains no LLM-thinking markers |
| `CITE_DIRECTIVE_SYNTAX_CLEAN` | 7V, 14V, 19V, 20V | No stray backtick before `{cite:[pt]}`; no missing opening backtick after |

## New validator checks (`comprev-curation-validator.md`)

- **Pre-flight shape check**: Phase 5V rejects `WRONG_ARTIFACT_TYPE` (e.g., a scaffold-extract VID where an evidence-package VID was expected) and `SCHEMA_INVALID` before running downstream checks
- `FINDINGS_ARE_OBJECTS`: same rule, now also at Phase 5V

## New validator checks (`comprev-scoping-validator.md`)

- `CLUSTER_SECTION_MAPPING_CONSISTENT`: the new `cluster_to_section_assignment` field in `gate_scope.json` is bidirectionally consistent with `clusters[].section_targets` and `sections[].cluster_ids`

## New canonical helpers

- `scan_prose(md_text, terms)` in `comprev-myst-validator.md` — code-block-aware prose scanner (mandatory for every prose-text check)
- `extract_cite_keys(md_text)` in `comprev-critic.md` — multi-key-decomposing cite-key extractor (mandatory for every cite-key-counting check)
- Canonical `figures/notebooks/shared_style.py` content baked into `comprev-figure-construction.md`

## Phase rule changes

- **Phase 5** (`comprev-dataml-phases.md`): explicit canonical schema for per-section evidence packages — `findings` is the array of finding objects; `argument_groups[*].supporting_findings` are cite-key strings
- **Phase 11** (`comprev-integration.md`): `master_citation_list` is computed as the union of cite-keys across body sections; Introduction and Conclusion may only cite from this set, asserted before `submit_output`. Frontmatter and AI-Disclosure are held to the same `FORBIDDEN_LEXICON` standard as bodies
- **Phase 14** (`comprev-dataml-phases.md`): bibliography file MUST be written to every path declared in `myst.yml` `project.bibliography` — and a stub at `content/references.bib` MUST be overwritten with the full Phase-9 bibliography
- **Phase 6** (`comprev-figure-audit.md`): SPLIT and REDESIGN verdicts permit two resolution routes — full figure-construction re-delegation, OR coordinator downgrade to `CAVEAT_FORCED` with the `suggested_restructure` injected as a `Phase 7 writer:` caveat (only when the restructure needs no new data)
- **Phase 6**: fabrication-flag resolution policy explicit — a flag is resolved when the figure caption cites via the canonical cite_key resolved from the DOI, the colloquial label is replaced, or the figure is rebuilt
- **Phase 2** (`comprev-evidence-gathering.md`): continuation children MUST treat `findings`, `conflicts`, `figure_data` as append-only with explicit shrink-prevention assertions
- **Phase 20** (`comprev-orchestrator-v29.md`): push child receives `section_md_vids_final` from the most recent validator gate (14V or 19V, with 19V taking precedence per-filename) and uses it verbatim; never calls `operon.artifacts(latest=True)` for content
- **Phase 20** (`comprev-deploy-polish.md`): canonical `deploy.yml` template that does NOT re-execute figure notebooks, plus a Pages-enable step that POSTs to `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pages` before the first push

## Process hygiene additions (`comprev-orchestrator-v29.md`)

- "Save-after-write race" section: prefer `language="bash"` when saving a file immediately after a python-kernel write
- "Canonical Artifact Maps Across Phases" section: validator gate JSONs MUST publish `section_md_vids_final` so Phase 20 push has an authoritative source

## Removed

- Historical justification sentences ("earlier deployments shipped with…", "pipeline runs prior to this revision…", "v1.0 dead widgets", "VIP v2 audit") — they added length without changing behavior
